# Security Fixes Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified by Supabase advisors and the fixes implemented in migration `007_security_fixes.sql`.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Fixed (ERROR Level)

### 1. SECURITY DEFINER Views
**Issue**: Views `payment_analyzer_stats` and `payment_analyzer_tables` were owned by postgres superuser and accessed system tables that regular users can't access, effectively running with elevated privileges.

**Risk**: Users could access sensitive system information through these views.

**Fix**: 
- Recreated both views as regular views that don't require elevated privileges
- Removed access to sensitive system tables (`pg_stats`, `pg_stat_user_tables`)
- Added clear documentation about the security changes

**Impact**: The views now return limited information but are much safer. For detailed statistics, use direct database queries or admin tools.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Issues Fixed (WARNING Level)

### 2. Function Search Path Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: 5 SECURITY DEFINER functions lacked explicit `search_path` settings:
- `get_timezone_names()`
- `refresh_timezone_cache_safe()`
- `get_common_timezones()`
- `search_timezones(text)`
- `refresh_timezone_cache()`

**Risk**: Search path injection attacks where malicious users could manipulate which schemas are searched first.

**Fix**: Added `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` to all functions.

**Impact**: Functions are now secure against search path manipulation attacks.

### 3. Materialized View API Access
**Issue**: `cached_timezone_names` materialized view was accessible to anonymous and authenticated users.

**Risk**: Minor - timezone data exposure (though this data is generally not sensitive).

**Fix**: 
- Documented that this is intentional for timezone data
- Restricted access to authenticated users only (removed anon access)
- Added clear documentation explaining the security decision

## üìã Manual Actions Required

### 1. Enable Leaked Password Protection
This cannot be fixed via database migration and must be done manually in the Supabase dashboard.

**Steps**:
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dplujrykiwabosrfmjgk/settings/auth)
2. Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Settings
3. Find "Password Protection" section
4. Enable "Check for compromised passwords"
5. Save changes

**Benefit**: Prevents users from using passwords that have been compromised in data breaches.

## üîß Testing the Fixes

### Run the Migration
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### Verify Security Fixes
After applying the migration, you can verify all functions are secure:

```sql
SELECT * FROM security_audit_functions();
```

This should show no HIGH risk functions.

### Re-run Security Audit
Check that the advisors are satisfied:
```bash
# Use the Supabase MCP tool or check the dashboard
```

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Security Audit Function
The migration includes a new `security_audit_functions()` function that can be run periodically to check for security issues:

```sql
-- Check for any security vulnerabilities
SELECT * FROM security_audit_functions() WHERE risk_level = 'HIGH';
```

### Regular Checks
- Run security audits after adding new functions
- Check Supabase advisors monthly
- Review function permissions when adding new features

## üéØ Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ‚úÖ All ERROR level security issues resolved
- ‚úÖ All WARNING level function security issues resolved  
- ‚úÖ Materialized view access documented and secured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual action required: Enable leaked password protection

The only remaining manual step is enabling leaked password protection in the Auth settings.

## üö® Breaking Changes

### Views Changed
- `payment_analyzer_stats`: Now returns limited information instead of full pg_stats data
- `payment_analyzer_tables`: Now returns basic table info instead of detailed statistics

If your application relies on the detailed statistics from these views, you'll need to:
1. Use direct queries to system tables with appropriate permissions
2. Create custom admin functions with proper security considerations
3. Use Supabase dashboard for detailed database statistics

### Materialized View Access
- `cached_timezone_names`: No longer accessible to anonymous users (only authenticated)

If you have anonymous access requirements for timezone data, use the `get_common_timezones()` function instead.

## üìù Additional Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `SELECT * FROM security_audit_functions()` monthly
2. **Function Reviews**: Always set explicit search_path for SECURITY DEFINER functions
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions to views and functions
4. **Documentation**: Document security decisions and trade-offs
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for new HIGH risk functions
